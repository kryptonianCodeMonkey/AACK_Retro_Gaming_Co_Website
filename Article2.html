	 <h2>Annual AACK! Convention</h2>
	 <div class="post">
		<h5>Author: Atinder Singh &nbsp &nbsp Date: December 1, 2019</h5>
		<p class="para">A few years ago, some of the leaders of AACK! Retro Gaming Company and our faithful fans decided that it would be a 
		great idea to have an annual meet-up or convention. This annual convention will be held on Dec 15 this year. At this event, fans from places all
		over come together to share their enthusiasm for AACK!. Not only do fans have a chance to meet each other, they will also get an early 
		sneak peek at games that will be released in the future. Another awesome reason for fans to attend the annual AACK! Convention is to have
		a chance to receive free giveaways, including exclusive games and merchandise. Many of AACK!â€™s biggest names will also be attending the 
		event, and we hope to see our fans as well. </p>
