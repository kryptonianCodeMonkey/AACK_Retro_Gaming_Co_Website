		<p class="para">The satisfaction of our customers has always been our number one priority at AACK! Retro Gaming Company. 
		This is why we work constantly to not only maintain a good gaming experience for our current games, but also add new 
		and exciting games frequently. Our main game designer, Cory K., has been working hard to add new games to our current lineup, 
		and is unveiling a new retro game this week. It is one of our most requested games, and customers have been patiently awaiting the 
		release of this game. Players will finally be able to enjoy the AACK! version of Solitaire starting Dec 8, 2019. </p>
